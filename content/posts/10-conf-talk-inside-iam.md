Conference Talk at [Inside IAM 2025](https://www.leaderscontact.com/de/events/inside-iam-2025/)

## How to go all-in on Passkeys
- How do you allow Passkeys exclusively for all users â€“ with no fallback to Password, SMS, Call or App?
- How do you ensure a secure registration and recovery?
- How do you enable legacy applications which are only capable of basic authentication?

In short: How do you go passwordless everywhere without fallback? 
We will share insights of the next steps towards an identity-centric zero-trust environment.
