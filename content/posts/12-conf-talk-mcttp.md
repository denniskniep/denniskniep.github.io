Conference Talk at [MCTTP 2025](https://www.mcttp.de/agenda)

## Topic: Secure your Identity

In today's digital landscape, robust identity management is crucial for ensuring security and efficiency for companies. In this session the journey of a DAX30 company will be shared how the identity space was changed to address modern threats and risks. For large multinationals with a legacy history this becomes a real challenge. We will share some insights of a comprehensive architecture and technology stack that is detached from common SaaS IDPs and vendor agnostic.

Modern infrastructure builds the baseline for an approach of multi-layered protection covering machine learning based attack detection, real phishing resistant authentication with an autonomous real-time threat detection to name some highlights.
