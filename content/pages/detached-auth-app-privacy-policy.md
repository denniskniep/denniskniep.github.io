Thank you for using the App ("Detached Auth"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users about the data collection practices of the App. We take your privacy seriously, and we aim to be transparent about how we handle your information.

### 1. Data Collection
The App does not collect, store, or share any personal data or information about its users. We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising frameworks. No personal information, device information, or browsing data is logged or retained by the App.

### 2. Websites Displayed via WebView
The App functions by rendering websites using a WebView. Please note that while the App itself does not collect any data, the websites you visit through the WebView may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies and practices. These third-party websites are not controlled or managed by us, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these external sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of any third-party websites you visit to understand their data collection and handling practices.

### 3. Responsibility for External Websites
The App acts solely as a viewer for arbitrary websites via the WebView and does not endorse, control, or have responsibility for the privacy practices or content of any websites accessed through the App. We encourage users to exercise caution and discretion when interacting with external websites.

### 4. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Please check this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy.
